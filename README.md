# Who am I
👋 Hi, I’m @dan-the-dev. 

Software Developer with passion and almost 10 years of experience, 
I started studying in high school in this field with the aim of living it and I succeeded: today I happily do a job that I'm passionate about.
Strongly fascinated and passionate about concepts such as Automated Testing and Agile Practices to make the work effective and qualitatively better, 
I like to take the time to stay up to date on the latest technologies and methodologies: 
I think it's very important to keep the curiosity about what's new coming through courses, conferences, meetups 
and continuous improvement and I think my ideal company should encourage this approach.
